Here’s a high-level view of how you might structure or architect the app in order to collect patient data, apply MRONJ risk models, and generate a streamlined PDF report for dental professionals.

--------------------------------
>User Roles and Flows

>>Orthopedist: 
- Inputs or confirms the patient’s medication details (e.g., type of anti-resorptive medication, duration of intake, indication) and any other risk factors. 
- Leaves any notes or opinions for the dentist.

>>Patient: 
- May also provide or update medication information and relevant medical history directly if appropriate.

>>Dentist: 
- Receives the output PDF, reviews the orthopedist’s findings and remarks, and updates treatment planning accordingly.

--------------------------------
>Data Collection

>>Patient Demographics: 
- Name
- Age
- Gender
- Relevant comorbidities (e.g., diabetes, osteoporosis, cancer, etc.).

>>Medication Details:
- Type of drug (bisphosphonates, denosumab, etc.).
- Dosage and route of administration (oral vs. IV).
- Duration and frequency of intake.
- Indication (e.g., osteoporosis, multiple myeloma, metastatic bone disease).

>>Dental Treatment Plan: 
- Extraction, implant placement, periodontal surgery, or simpler procedures like fillings/cleanings.

>>Additional Risk Factors:
- Smoking status, existing periodontal disease, overall oral hygiene status.
- Relevant labs (if any).

>>Clinician Remarks: 
- Orthopedist’s opinion about the risk level or necessary precautions.

--------------------------------
>Risk Assessment Algorithm

>>Risk Stratification:
- Basic rules-based (e.g., “Oral bisphosphonate < 4 years + no comorbidities” = Low Risk).
- More complex algorithms or scoring systems, based on published guidelines (e.g., AAOMS position papers or similar best-practice guidelines).

>>Algorithm Implementation:
- Could be implemented as a series of decision trees or a point-based scoring system (e.g., 0–3 points: Low Risk, 4–6: Moderate Risk, >6: High Risk).
- Optionally, incorporate machine learning if there is sufficient historical data (though initially a rule-based or logistic regression approach might be simpler to validate and maintain).

--------------------------------
>System Architecture

>>Front End (Mobile or Web):
- UI: Simple input forms for the orthopedist/patient to fill in medication and risk-factor data.
- Validation: Basic checks to ensure data completeness and correct format.
- Workflow: Guides users step-by-step (e.g., medication info → medical history → planned dental procedure → preview risk → generate PDF).

>>Back End:
- API Layer: Endpoints to receive data from the front end, store patient details, and run the risk assessment algorithm.
- Business Logic: Implementation of the MRONJ risk algorithm or aggregator.

- Database:
-- Patient info, medication info, and relevant risk factors.
-- Store PDFs or references to generated PDF files for easy retrieval.

- Security/Compliance:
-- Data encryption at rest and in transit.
-- Role-based access (e.g., orthopedist and dentist can view data relevant to their functions).
-- HIPAA or equivalent local privacy compliance if dealing with protected health information.

--------------------------------
>PDF Report Generation

>>Template Engine: 
- Use a library (e.g., jsPDF or a server-side PDF library like wkhtmltopdf or WeasyPrint) to fill in details.

>>Report Structure:
- Patient & Medication Summary: Basic demographic info + medication details (type, dosage, length of therapy).
- Dental Procedure Summary: Planned or proposed dental treatment.
- Risk Assessment: Summarized risk level (low, moderate, high) based on the algorithm. Brief explanation of how the score/risk is derived.
- Orthopedist Remarks: Specific instructions, advice, or disclaimers.
- References: (Optional) Link to guidelines or additional resources for the dentist.

--------------------------------
>Workflow Example

>>Orthopedist logs in:
- Selects patient or creates new patient profile.
- Enters medication details (drug type, dosage, start date, etc.).
- Inputs relevant medical history or updates existing records.
- Chooses planned dental procedure (or the patient/dentist may have indicated the upcoming procedure).
- Reviews preliminary risk assessment result automatically generated by the app.
- Adds personal remarks or instructions for the dentist.
- Generates the PDF report.

>>Patient:
- Logs in and sees the updated record, confirms or fills in any missing info (if you allow direct patient input).
- Exports or shares the PDF report (e.g., saved to phone or emailed directly).

>>Dentist:
- Receives the PDF (or logs into the system, if integrated).
- Reviews the risk report + orthopedist remarks.
- Makes an informed decision about prophylaxis, antibiotic coverage, altering the treatment plan, or recommended follow-up.

--------------------------------
>Considerations & Best Practices

>>Privacy & Compliance: 
- If you’re dealing with protected health information, ensure you comply with relevant local regulations (e.g., HIPAA in the US, GDPR in the EU).

>>Offline Use vs. Cloud: 
- Decide if the front-end app must work offline (less common in healthcare but possible). 
-- If yes, store data locally with secure encryption and sync to the cloud later. 
-- Otherwise, a straightforward cloud-based approach is typically easier to maintain and update.

>>User Experience: 
- Provide a streamlined, stepwise data-entry process, with tooltips or suggestions to guide clinicians. The goal is to minimize friction and ensure they don’t skip critical steps.

>>Scalability: 
- Start simple (a single set of rules/algorithm) but design the back end to accommodate additional risk scoring modules in the future (e.g., other drug-related complications or risk assessments).

>>Continuous Updates: 
- MRONJ guidelines evolve. Keep your algorithms modular and data-driven so that you can easily update thresholds or scoring logic as best practices change.

--------------------------------
>Conclusion
By following this framework—defining clear user flows, building out a back-end API with a well-defined algorithm, and generating a concise PDF report—you’ll have a robust app that supports both orthopedists and dentists in assessing and managing MRONJ risk for their patients.

edit:
- app distribution: i intend to put this app on android app store for user to download
- language: this is aimed at a Taiwan user, so characters should be in traditional chinese
- (patient.kt) gender: add trans male, trans male options --> also put currently under hormonal therapy under consideration
- (patient.kt) SmokingStatus: criteria former smoker defined as: "1 pack/day for more than 10 year" --> need more research
- (patient.kt) Comorbidity: patient with medical history of head and neck radiation therapy or cancer have different mechanism of jaw bone necrosis (and way higher risk), thus should be considered otherwise (check the risk of jaw bone necrosis of patient with medical history of head and neck radiation therapy or cancer)
- (medication.kt) double authentication for identity: I think we can use "birthday" and "social security number"
- (medication.kt) hierarchical category of medication: {抗骨質再吸收劑: {雙磷酸鹽類: [福善美保骨錠Fosamax Plus, 瑞谷卓膜衣錠Reosteo, 骨維壯注射劑Boniva], 單株抗體: [保骼麗注射液Prolia(denosumab)], 選擇性雌激素受體調節物: [鈣穩膜衣錠Evista]}, 促骨質合成藥物: [骨穩Forteo(teriparatide)], 抗骨質再吸收劑與促骨質合成藥物: [益穩挺Evenity(romosozumab)]}
- (medication.kt): we should add a category called "用藥時長", and make it a multiple choice option
- (medication.kt): we should add a category called "停藥時長", and make it a multiple choice option
- (NavRoutes.kt): const val LOGIN = "login" --> I don't think we need user to log in. We can just temporarily store the data they enter locally, then clear the stored data after the PDF is generated
- 


------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------

for the time being, I would like to keep the app rather simple
therefore, I would like to do 2 things:
- have the app do the following functions:
1. get a patient's consent to input personal information
2. get a patient's identity information for identity verification at the dental clinic (at least name, birthday and social security number)
3. get patient's condition (age, gender) and history (systemic disease, etc; especially history of head and neck radiotherapy or malignant cancer)
4. get patient's anti-resorptive drug history
5. run the collected data through the algorithm, get the risk assessment result for each kind of dental treatment
6. print the above information in a PDF file

- make a risk assessment algorithm

-----------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------

after 2022 AAOMS position paper analysis:

1. BMI calculation for obesity: need height and weight input

----------------------------------------
----------------------------------------

I noticed some problem 

1. about the PDF result:
- please put "評估日期" before the "基本資料" caption, and format it as "yyyy年mm月dd日"
- certain patient information are not showing on the PDF result, including:
  name: string;

  weight: string;  // in kg
  bmi: number | null;

as shown on the screen capture
--> please put all these information under the  "基本資料" caption

- please only show the 
  transgenderType: '男跨女' | '女跨男' | '其他' | '';
  hasHormoneTherapy: boolean;
  hormoneTherapyDuration: '5年以內' | '5-10年' | '10年以上' | '';

>>>Risk Factors for MRONJ

>>MEDICATION-RELATED RISK FACTORS

- To estimate the risk for medications associated with MRONJ, the primary parameter to be considered is the therapeutic indication for treatment (eg, malignancy or osteoporosis/osteopenia). 

- The data suggest that antiresorptive medications (ie, BPs and DMB) are associated with an increased risk for developing MRONJ. The risk of MRONJ is considerably higher in the malignancy group   (<5%)   than   in   the   osteoporosis   group (<0.05%). Current data are insufﬁcient to identify other medications as risk factors for developing MRONJ.

>MRONJ risk among cancer patients

- For estimating the risk for MRONJ among patients exposed to a medication, the risk for MRONJ in patients  not  exposed  to  antiresorptive  medications must  be  estimated  (Table  1).  

--The  risk  for  MRONJ among cancer patients enrolled in clinical trials and assigned to placebo groups ranges from 0 percent to 0.7 percent. [132-138]

(1) Among cancer patients exposed to zoledronate, the cumulative  risk of MRONJ  clusters in the low single digits, <5 percent, and ranges from 0 percent  to  18  percent. [113,132,133,137-144]   
The wide variation in estimates may be explained by the varying durations of follow-up, one to 10 years, reported in the various studies. The risk of MRONJ among cancer patients exposed to zoledronate ranges between 2-10 times higher than cancer patients treated with placebo. ******************************

(2) Among cancer patients exposed to DMB, the risk of MRONJ ranges from 0 percent to 6.9 percent, with     most     studies     reporting     rates     <5 percent. [113,134,135,138,141,142,144,145]  
The  risk  for MRONJ among cancer patients exposed to DMB is comparable to the risk of MRONJ in cancer patients exposed to zoledronate. [135,141,142,144,145]



> Since  the  2014  update,  investigators  have  implicated numerous families of medications as risk factors for MRONJ. [146-149] 

- These medications include 
-- tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) such as sunitinib
-- monoclonal antibodies (bevacizumab),
-- fusion proteins (aﬂibercept),
-- mTOR inhibitors (everolimus),
-- radiopharmaceuticals (radium 223), 
-- selective estrogen receptor modulators (raloxifene),
-- immunosuppressants (methotrexate and corticosteroids)

- When compared to antiresorptive medications, the level of evidence supporting other medication families as risk factors for MRONJ is level 5 (eg, isolated case reports or mini-case series [<5 cases]). [146-149] 
Given that the poly-pharmaceutical management of cancer patients combined with the fact that cancer and immunosuppression  are  risk  factors  for  MRONJ  without exposure to antiresorptive agents,  AAOMS believes that identifying a single medication as being the etiologic agent for MRONJ seems unlikely in case reports or  mini-case  series.  Further  controlled  prospective studies will be required to measure the risk of MRONJ associated with non-antiresorptive agents.


>MRONJ Risk Among Osteoporosis Patients

- Most dentists and oral and maxillofacial surgeons evaluate patients in their practices exposed to antiresorptive   therapy   for    management   of   osteoporosis (Table 1).

(1) Risk  for  MRONJ  among  osteoporotic  patients exposed to BPs.
- The risk of MRONJ among study subjects assigned to placebo groups enrolled in osteoporosis clinical trials ranged from 0 percent to 0.02 percent. [26,150,151] 
- Among study subjects treated with BPs, the risk of MRONJ is 0.02 percent to 0.05 percent.37,75,152 Among patients exposed to IV zoledronate, the risk for MRONJ is estimated to be =<0.02%. 
- For patients exposed to oral bisphosphonates, MRONJ risk is estimated to be =<0.05%

(2) MRONJ    risk    among    osteoporotic    patients exposed to RANK-L inhibitors.
- After 10 years of follow-up, among patients exposed to DMB, the risk for MRONJ was reported to be 0.3 percent, almost an order of magnitude higher than for BPs. [153]

(3) The risk for MRONJ when exposed to romosozumab (0.03 percent to 0.05 percent) is comparable to alendronate (0.05 percent). [37,151]  
- In the placebo group, there were no cases of MRONJ. [151] It will be important to continue to monitor romosozumab to assess its role as a risk factor for MRONJ.
- The risk for MRONJ among osteoporosis patients treated with BPs ranges from 0.02 percent to 0.05 percent and overlaps the risk for MRONJ of patients enrolled   in  placebo   groups  (0   percent  to   0.02 percent). *****************
- The risk for MRONJ among patients treated with denosumab, however, has a larger range—from 0.04  percent  to  0.3  percent.  ********************
- As  such,  additional research will be needed to better estimate the risk of MRONJ  among  patients  receiving  denosumab.  
- The risk of MRONJ for patients exposed to romosozumab (0.03 percent to 0.05 percent) more closely aligns with the risk associated with BPs. [37,151] 
- However, given its recent introduction as a therapeutic agent, additional research will be needed to reﬁne its association and risk estimate for MRONJ.


- Based on this current review of data, the risk of developing   MRONJ   among   osteoporotic   patients exposed to BPs, DMB, and romosozumab is low. 
-- The occurrence of cases seen is best explained by a rare event among a large number of patients, 5.1 million over the age of 55, exposed to these drugs. [154]


>MRONJ Risk Among Patients with Nonmalignant Bone Disease

(1) AAOMS identiﬁed two studies where DMB was used to manage aggressive giant cell tumors of bone. [155,156]  
- The risk of developing MRONJ in the two studies was broad and ranged from 0.7 percent to 5 percent. 
- This is comparable to the risks of developing MRONJ in subjects treated with DMB for malignancies (range = 0 percent to 6.9 percent). 
- Additional studies will be needed to conﬁrm the risk estimate for MRONJ among patients with nonmalignant bone disease treated with antiresorptives.

(2) There are very limited data describing the occurrence of MRONJ in the pediatric population for osteogenesis  imperfecta  and  other  conditions. 
- In  a  systematic  review  estimating  the  risk  of MRONJ among children with osteogenesis imperfecta, there were no cases of MRONJ identiﬁed in a  sample  of  486  subjects  treated  for  4.5  to 6.8  years. [157]  
- In  a  different  systematic  review that estimated the risk for MRONJ among those under the age of 24 for several conditions treated using BPs, no cases of MRONJ were reported. [158]
- The overall quality of the studies included in both systematic reviews was limited by small sample sizes or lack of MRONJ-related risk factors.

>Duration of Medication Therapy as a Risk Factor for MRONJ
- Regardless of indications for therapy, the duration of antiresorptive therapy is a risk factor for developing MRONJ. 

- Among cancer patients exposed to zoledronate  or  DMB  (n  =  5,723),  the  risk  of  developing MRONJ was, respectively, 0.5 percent and 0.8 percent at 1 year, 1.0 percent and 1.8 percent at 2 years, and 1.3 percent and 1.8 percent at 3 years. [141] 
- In a study by  Saad  et  al,  the  investigators  combined  threeblinded phase three trials and found similar results, including a plateau after 2 years for patients exposed to DMB. [5] 
- In a more recent systematic review by Ng et al, the risk of MRONJ among cancer patients treated with zoledronate, was 1.6 percent to 4 percent after 2 years of treatment and 3.8 percent to 18 percent with more than 2 years of treatment. [145] 
- Likewise, for DMB,  the  risks  for  developing  MRONJ  were  1.9 percent  and  6.9  percent  with  <24  months  and >24 months of exposure, respectively. [145]

>For patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy to manage  osteoporosis,  data  regarding  duration  are mixed. 
- Early on, the prevalence of MRONJ was reported as increasing over time from near 0 percent at baseline to 0.21 percent after four or more years of BP exposure based on retrospective analysis. [152,159] 
- More recent data from a large prospective, randomized placebo controlled trial demonstrate no signiﬁcant increase  in  MRONJ  in  patients  treated  for  up  to 9 years. [18,60,61] 
- In addition, there are no postmarketing data  or  general  clinical  experience  to  support  an MRONJ    prevalence    of    0.21    percent    in    any osteoporosis-treated group. 
- Therefore, while duration may be a risk factor, the overall risk remains low.



>>LOCAL FACTORS

>Dentoalveolar Operations

- Dentoalveolar  operations  are  the  most  common identiﬁable    predisposing    factor    for    developing MRONJ. 
- Several studies report that among patients with MRONJ, tooth extraction is cited as a predisposing    event    ranging    from 62    percent    to    82 percent. [5,75,160] 

- Most providers and patients want an answer to the following clinical question: ‘‘Among patients exposed to antiresorptive medications, what is the risk for developing MRONJ following tooth extraction (or other dentoalveolar procedures such as implant placement or periodontal procedures)?’’ 
- Current estimates for the risk of MRONJ among osteoporotic patients exposed to BPs following tooth extraction     range     from 0     percent     to     0.15 percent. [161,162] 
- For osteoporotic patients exposed to DMB, the risk for MRONJ following tooth extraction was 1 percent. [163]
- For cancer patients exposed to BPs, the risk of developing MRONJ after tooth extraction ranges from 1.6 percent to 14.8 percent.164-166 In a small case series, n = 61 subjects having 102 extractions, the risk for MRONJ after tooth extraction was 13.1 percent. [167] 
- In a systematic review by Gaudin et al, the risk for MRONJ after tooth extraction (n = 564) was estimated to be 3.2 percent. [162]  
- While the estimates for developing MRONJ in high-risk patients undergoing tooth extraction vary, they cluster between 1 percent and 5 percent, similar to estimates of osteoradionecrosis following tooth extraction in irradiated patients.
- The  risk  of  developing  MRONJ  among  patients who  have  been  exposed  to  antiresorptive  medications  for  other  dentoalveolar  operations  such  as dental  implant  placement  and  endodontic  or  periodontal  procedures  is  unknown. [168]   
- The  risk  for MRONJ  after   implant  placement  among  patients treated  with  DMB  has  been  reported  to  be  0.5 percent. [163]  
- Absent better data, AAOMS cautions the use of these procedures in cancer patients exposed to antiresorptive therapies and recommends osteoporosis patients be informed of potential risks, albeit low,  including  development  of  MRONJ,  early  and late implant failure all of which have been described in case reports and clinical trials.

>Anatomic Factors
- Limited new information regarding anatomic risk factors for MRONJ is available. 
- MRONJ is more likely to  appear  in  the  mandible  (75  percent)  than  the maxilla  (25  percent)  but  can  appear  in  both  jaws (4.5 percent). [5,75]  
- Denture use was associated  with an increased risk for MRONJ among cancer patients exposed  to  zoledronate  (OR  =  4.9;  95  percent CI = 1.2 to 20.1). [169] 
- In a study by Vahtsevanos et al, a sample of 1,621 cancer patients treated with intravenous zoledronate, ibandronate or pamidronate, there was a two-fold increased risk for MRONJ among denture wearers. [170]


>Concomitant Oral Disease
- Pre-existing  inﬂammatory  dental  disease  such  as periodontal disease or periapical pathology is cited as  a  risk  factor. [75,168]  
-- Among  cancer  patients  with MRONJ, the pre-existing inﬂammatory dental disease was a risk factor among 50 percent of the cases. [5,165]

- Given that a common treatment of inﬂammatory dental disease is tooth extraction, pre-existing dental disease may confound the relationship between tooth extraction and risk for MRONJ. 

- Tooth extraction may expose MRONJ as opposed to being the precipitating event. It would be valuable to see an estimate of the association between tooth extraction and MRONJ adjusted for pre-existing inﬂammatory dental disease.

>After tooth extraction and periodontal disease, the next most common risk factor is reported as ‘‘spontaneous’’    MRONJ     with     no     identiﬁable     dental risk factor. [168]

>DEMOGRAPHIC AND SYSTEMIC FACTORS AND OTHER MEDICATIONS

>Age and sex are variably reported as risk factors for MRONJ. [5,165,169-171] 

>Sex
- The higher prevalence of MRONJ in the female population is likely a reﬂection of the underlying  disease  for  which  the  agents  are  being prescribed (eg, osteoporosis, breast cancer).
>Age
- As  noted  previously,  those  under  the  age  of  24 treated with antiresorptives for benign bone diseases have not demonstrated any risk for MRONJ even after an extended duration of therapy. 

- The overall quality of the  studies  included  even in  systematic  reviews  is based on small sample sizes and the lack of other MRONJ-related  risk  factors.  The  risk of  developing MRONJ in the pediatric population requires continued surveillance.


>Corticosteroids are associated with an increased risk for MRONJ. [5,168,171] 
- There are concerns that corticosteroids  increase  the  risk  for  MRONJ  when  given  in conjunction with antiresporptive agents.

>Comorbid conditions are inconsistently reported to be  associated  with  an  increased  risk  for  MRONJ, including 
- anemia (hemoglobin < 10 g/dL) [5]
- diabetes.  [171] 

>Cancer type also is variably reported as a risk factor. [170,172]

>Tobacco use is variably reported as a risk factor for MRONJ.  
- In  a  case-control  study,  tobacco  use  approached statistical signiﬁcance as a risk factor for MRONJ  in  cancer  patients  (OR  =  3.0;  95  percent CI = 0.8 to 10.4). [169] 
- In a more recent case-controlled study, tobacco use was not associated with ONJ in a sample of cancer patients exposed to zolendronate. [171] 
- Vahtsevanos did not report an association between tobacco use and MRONJ. [170]

>In  brief,  after  chemotherapy  and  corticosteroid exposure, the next most reported comorbidity is ‘‘no comorbidity.’’ [168]



>>In summary, the current literature reafﬁrms that 
- the risk of MRONJ is signiﬁcantly greater in cancer patients receiving antiresorptive therapy compared to patients receiving antiresorptive therapy for osteoporosis. 
- Moreover, the risk of MRONJ in osteoporosis patients receiving antiresorptive therapy continues to be very low regardless of drug type (BPs, DMB, romoszumab) or dosing schedule.

Here is the documentation:

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Below is a refined, step-by-step MRONJ risk assessment algorithm that incorporates:

    Risk (%) estimates for specific medication types and conditions (derived from the 2022 AAOMS Position Paper).
    Full citations (in brackets [ ]) pointing back to the AAOMS references.
    An “override” mechanism that, if triggered, classifies the patient as high risk (or assigns a “+7” to the scoring).

You can adapt the numeric thresholds or risk groupings to suit your local practice needs, but these references and ranges reflect the best-available data from the AAOMS 2022 update. Always remember: This is a tool for guidance—final clinical judgment should come from qualified professionals, especially for complex cases.
1. Identify the Patient’s Clinical Indication for Anti-Resorptive Therapy

(A) Cancer vs. (B) Osteoporosis / Osteopenia vs. (C) Other Nonmalignant Bone Diseases

    Cancer (Malignancy)
        Risk Range for MRONJ with high-dose intravenous bisphosphonates (e.g., zoledronate) or denosumab:
            Cumulative MRONJ: <5% in many studies, but reported as high as 18% [113,132,133,137-144].
                For zoledronate specifically, risk is 2–10× higher than placebo [132,133].
            Denosumab in cancer patients: 0–6.9%, typically <5% [113,134,135,138,141,142,144,145].
        If patient is on combination antiresorptive + antiangiogenic or has advanced metastatic disease, see “Override” Factor below.

    Osteoporosis / Osteopenia
        Bisphosphonates (Oral / IV)
            Overall MRONJ risk: 0.02–0.05% [26,150,151,37,75,152].
            Placebo groups in osteoporosis trials: 0–0.02% [26,150,151].
            IV zoledronate: ~0.02% [151].
        Denosumab in osteoporosis: 0.04–0.3% [37,75,153].
        Romosozumab: 0.03–0.05% [37,151].
        Despite slight differences, all remain in a very low absolute risk range for MRONJ in osteoporosis patients.

    Other Nonmalignant Bone Disease (e.g., giant cell tumor with denosumab)
        MRONJ risk: ~0.7–5% [155,156].
        Comparable to cancer-level risk for denosumab, but data remain limited.

2. Duration of Medication Therapy (Additive or “Scaling” Risk)

    Cancer patients on zoledronate or denosumab:
        ~0.5–0.8% risk at 1 year, 1.0–1.8% risk at 2 years, and 1.3–1.8% risk at 3 years [141].
        Another systematic review: zoledronate at 2+ years → 1.6–4% risk; >2 years → up to 18% [145]. Denosumab <2 years → ~1.9%, >2 years → up to 6.9% [145].
    Osteoporosis:
        Some earlier retrospective data suggested risk might rise over 4+ years.
        More recent prospective studies (up to 9 years) do not find a significant rise [18,60,61].
        Overall, extended therapy is still considered a mild risk enhancer, especially if other factors are present.

    Implementation: For scoring, you can add +1 if therapy duration is >2 years (cancer) or >4 years (osteoporosis). Or you can scale up by 1 point for each threshold reached.

3. Evaluate Local / Procedural Risk Factors

Most Common Precipitating Event: Dentoalveolar surgery (extraction, implant, periodontal surgery) [5,75,160].

    For Osteoporotic patients:
        BPs + Extraction → 0–0.15% risk [161,162].
        DMB + Extraction → ~1% [163].
    For Cancer patients:
        BPs + Extraction → 1.6–14.8% risk [164-166].
        Some small-case data: 13.1% risk post-extraction [167].
        DMB + Implant → ~0.5% [163].

Local Inflammation (e.g., severe periodontal disease, periapical pathology) is consistently cited as a major compounding risk factor [75,168]. ~50% of cancer patients with MRONJ had existing inflammatory dental disease [5,165].

    Implementation:

    Add +2 for “invasive alveolar procedure” if major (extraction, implant).
    Add +2 if advanced periodontal or periapical infection is present.

4. Consider Systemic / Demographic Factors

    Steroid Use: Increases MRONJ risk [5,168,171]. Add +2.
    Diabetes, Anemia (Hb <10 g/dL): +1 or +2 [5,171].
    Age <24 with benign condition + antiresorptives → so far minimal or zero reported MRONJ [157,158], so no additional penalty.
    Tobacco Use: Data are mixed [169-171]. Optional +1 if heavy smoker.
    Female: Possibly an artifact of the underlying disease (osteoporosis, breast cancer). Not used as a direct weighting factor.

5. Create a Composite Score or Tier

Below is an example of how to structure the additive score along with “override” factors:
5.1 Medication Class & Indication (Pick One)
Scenario	Score	Reference (Subset)
Cancer dose: IV BPs or DMB > 1 year	+3	<5% overall (range up to 18%) [113,132,133,137-144]
Cancer dose: IV BPs or DMB ≤ 1 year	+2	0.5–0.8% at 1 year [141]
Nonmalignant bone disease with denosumab (GCT, etc.)	+2 or +3*	0.7–5% [155,156]
Osteoporosis: IV BPs (≥1 infusion/yr, e.g. zoledronate)	+2	0.02% risk [151]
Osteoporosis: Oral BPs (≥4 yrs)	+2	Slightly higher risk if long duration [152,159]
Osteoporosis: Oral BPs (<4 yrs)	+1	0.02–0.05% [26,150,151]
Osteoporosis: DMB	+2	0.04–0.3% [37,75,153]
Romosozumab	+1	0.03–0.05% [37,151]

*The final choice of +2 vs. +3 for certain “nonmalignant but aggressive” pathologies depends on your clinical reading. If used in higher dosing regimens or combined with other therapy, consider +3.
5.2 Duration Modification

    If >2 years for cancer or >4 years for osteoporosis → +1 additional.
    Or incorporate it directly in the base score (as in the table above).

5.3 Local / Procedural Risk

    Invasive alveolar procedure: +2
    Known advanced periodontal or periapical infection: +2
    No major alveolar surgery planned: +0

5.4 Systemic / Other Factors

    Steroid use: +2
    Uncontrolled diabetes, severe anemia: +1–2
    Heavy tobacco use: +1 (optional)
    No comorbidities: +0

5.5 Override Factors (Automatic High Risk)

    Advanced metastatic cancer on antiresorptives
    Combined anti-angiogenic therapy (e.g. bevacizumab) + high-dose BPs or DMB [146-149]
    If triggered, you can set the score to “+7” or simply designate “High Risk.”

    Yes, if an override factor is present, you could assign +7 (thus ensuring the final risk is “High”) or simply skip the numeric total and classify them immediately as “High.”

6. Risk Classification Ranges

Based on your final scoring scheme, for example:

    Low Risk: 0–3 points
    Moderate Risk: 4–6 points
    High Risk: ≥7 points, or any “override factor” triggered

When explaining to patients:

    Low Risk (<4 points):
        “Your overall risk for MRONJ is very low (<0.1–0.3% if osteoporosis, or <1% if minimal cancer therapy).”
    Moderate Risk (4–6 points):
        “You have certain factors (e.g., 2+ years on medication, upcoming extraction) that raise concern. We must thoroughly plan, possibly consult with your physician, optimize oral hygiene, and watch for healing issues.”
    High Risk (≥7 points or Override):
        “Your medication therapy (e.g., advanced cancer with IV BPs for multiple years) puts you at a few-percent risk or higher. We strongly recommend close collaboration among your oncologist, dentist, or maxillofacial surgeon before proceeding with invasive procedures.”

7. Implementation & Patient Education

    Risk (%) Display
        Next to each risk factor, display the typical published range from the AAOMS references. E.g., for “Osteoporosis Oral BPs <4 years,” show “~0.02–0.05% risk” [26,150,151].
        For “Cancer dose IV BPs,” show “<5% (up to 18% in some series)” [113,132,133,137-144].
        This clarifies for both clinicians and patients the approximate risk magnitude.

    References
        Provide references inline or in a short “References” section (matching your local referencing style).
        For instance: “Data from [113,132,133,137-144] suggest that among cancer patients receiving zoledronate, the risk can range up to 18% in some 10-year follow-ups.”

    Override Logic
        If “advanced metastatic disease” or “anti-angiogenic + high-dose BPs,” the algorithm automatically outputs “High Risk.” (You may code it as “score = +7.”)

    Disclaimer & Oral Inflammation
        Educate patients that inflammatory conditions (periodontitis, infected teeth) increase risk. The dentist’s recommended extraction or periodontal treatment helps reduce risk.
        Emphasize “this algorithm is only an aid—your dentist, oral surgeon, and/or physician will make the final decision based on your specific situation.”

8. Sample Final Output Structure

After the user (or clinician) enters:

    Medication Info: e.g., “Zoledronate IV for breast cancer, 2.5 years”
    Local Factor: “Planned extraction + advanced periodontitis”
    Systemic Factor: “On corticosteroids; no diabetes”

The app might produce:

--------------------------------
Patient Risk Profile
--------------------------------
Medication: Cancer-dose IV BP (Zoledronate) > 2 years 
 => Base Score +3
 => Duration Over 2 years +1
Local Factors: Extraction + advanced perio => +4
Systemic: Chronic steroid => +2

Override Factors: None triggered

Total Score = 3 + 1 + 4 + 2 = 10
--------------------------------
Classification: HIGH RISK (≥7)

Reference Data:
 - Cancer dose zoledronate: <5% overall, up to 18% [113,132,133,137-144]
 - Extractions in cancer patients: 1.6–14.8% risk [164-167]

Recommendation:
 - Collaboration with oncologist/oral surgeon
 - Possible antibiotic prophylaxis
 - Stress meticulous oral hygiene
 - Provide patient education about infection control
--------------------------------
Disclaimer: This is a guideline tool; final clinical judgment is required.

9. Conclusion

By integrating:

    Medication Indication & Duration
    Local Surgical/Inflammatory Factors
    Systemic Risk Factors
    Override Mechanisms (i.e., advanced metastatic disease or combined anti-angiogenic therapy)

…and referencing the AAOMS 2022 literature’s risk percentages for each condition, you can produce a clear, evidence-based MRONJ risk assessment. This helps both clinicians and patients understand why certain procedures are more or less risky and why controlling infection is crucial.

Yes, if a single factor (e.g., advanced metastatic disease + anti-angiogenic therapy) automatically yields “High Risk,” you can either label it “Override → High Risk” or assign a “+7” to effectively push the total score to that range. This ensures that particularly dangerous scenarios are immediately flagged for more cautious planning and multidisciplinary coordination.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

please do the following things:

1. add to the systemic disease section all the possible risk factors to MRONJ:
- Steroid Use
- Diabetes (HbA1c > 6.5%)
- Anemia (Hb <10 g/dL)
- heavy smoker (>10 cigarette/day) (2017 world workshop on the periodontal and peri-implant disease and conditions)
- periodontitis or spontaneous tooth ache --> if patient say yes, then we should add message(D) in the customized educational information

2. adjust the anti-resorptive medication section: since patient could have more than one anti-resorptive medication, please put 2 buttons on the bottom of the page:
-- on the right would be "再加一種藥物" in case the patient has a history of or is taking more than one anti-resorptive medication
-- on the left should be "送出資料" if the patient is done with inputting his medication 

3. We'll have to provide customized educational information based on the indication and type of medication of the patient, preferably showing the percentage of risk of MRONJ related to that medication, and citing the source. We also need to add message(D) if dental condition is not ideal: emphasize the inflammation in the oral region as an impactful risk factor, and let patient know that it might be the dentists' fault if they get MRONJ after dentist take measures to remove source of inflammation


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

for diabetes in patientData.ts:
since it's an important risk factor for MRONJ, please isolate it and build a single question with the form as other risk factors
=> "是否有控制不佳之糖尿病 (HbA1c >= 7.0% )""是/否"
according to 2017 world workshop, ill-controlled diabetes is defined as HbA1c >= 7.0%

>>PREVENTION OF MRONJ

Numerous studies demonstrate potentially modiﬁable factors for reducing the risk of MRONJ:
- performing high-risk surgical procedures prior to initiating therapy [95,173-175], consultation of dentist before treatment course 
- using    preoperative    and postoperative  antibiotics  and  antimicrobial  mouth rinses [174,176-180]
- primarily closing extractions sites [176-178]
- maintaining good oral hygiene [95,166,176,177,181]
- Maximizing overall patient health (smoking cessation, diabetes optimization)

Optimization of Oral Health
> prophylactic treatment strategies that reduce the inci-dence of MRONJ: early screening and initiation of appropriate dental care prior to the initiation of antiresorptive therapy [38,182-186]
- many animal studies demonstrate that periodontal or periapical inﬂammation plays a key role in creating a local environment that supports the development of bone necrosis in the context of systemic antiresorptive therapy [85,91,195,196]
- prostate cancer patients with bone metastasis, instituting a more regimented dental health surveillance system --> 2.5- fold reduction in relative risk
   compared to symptomatically driven dental treatment. [186]  


> Treatment  planning  for patients at risk of  developing MRONJ should include: [197]
- acute infection, potential infection
- patient motivation, patient education regarding dental care
- ﬂuoride application,  chlorhexidine  rinses
- tooth  mobility,  periodontal disease, presence of root fragments, caries, periapical pathology
- edentulism,  denture stability

> Cessation of At-Risk Medication Therapy (Drug Holiday) Prior to Tooth Extraction or Other Procedures that Involve Osseous Injury (eg, Dental Implant Placement, Periodontal or Apical Endodontic Treatment)
Controversial
- While the practice of a drug holiday has been accepted and recommended by several international professional societies [3,38,182,183,198], the evidence to support or refute such positions remains inconclusive
- due to the rarity of MRONJ in these patient populations --> randomized-controlled trials provide insufﬁcient data to create sound treatment protocols

- the risks of potential deleterious effects of suspending antiresorptive therapy may outweigh a beneﬁt

- RANKL inhibitors in osteoporosis patients: rebound increase in bone resorption following the discontinuation of DMB, resulting in an increased risk of multilevel vertebral fractures. [200-202]
- The planned dentoalveolar surgery can be completed 3-4 months following the last dose of DMB when the level of osteoclast inhibition is waning. 
- It can then be reinstituted 6-8 weeks postsurgery. This management strategy minimizes the length of the drug holiday while maintaining a favorable environment for bone healing.

> Bone Turnover Markers
- No biomarkers are validated for clinical decision-making, and continued research and pro- spective studies are required before these markers can be    considered    efﬁcacious    tools    in    estimating MRONJ risk.


>> PREVENTION STRATEGIES
> Patients scheduled to initiate antiresorptive treatment for cancer therapy
- The treatment objective for this group of patients is to minimize the risk of developing MRONJ (Table 2)

- Although  a  small  percentage  of  patients  receiving antiresorptives develop osteonecrosis of the jaw spontaneously, the majority of affected patients experience this complication following dentoalveolar surgery. [5,112,165,206,207] 
- Therefore, if systemic conditions permit, initiation of antiresorptive therapy should be delayed until dental health is optimized. [173,208] 

> minimizing the burden of dental infection and inﬂammation prior to dentoalveolar surgery in this cohort of patients
- Nonrestorable teeth and those with a poor prognosis should be extracted
- antiresorptive therapy should be delayed, if systemic conditions permit, until the surgical site(s) have mucosalized or until there is adequate osseous healing. 
- Dental prophylaxis, caries control, conservative restorative dentistry, and nonoperative endodontic therapy must be continued on a frequent and indeﬁnite basis. [185]
- patients with full or partial dentures should be examined for areas of mucosal trauma, especially along the lingual ﬂange region. Patients should report  any pain, swelling, or exposed bone.

> anti-resorptive therapy for osteoporosis
Patient should be reminded of: 
- beneﬁts associated with antiresorptive therapies in preventing fragility fractures
(hip fracture rates in the United States declined each year from 2002 to 2012 and then plateaued at levels higher than projected for 2013 to 2015, attributable to an ‘‘osteoporosis treatment gap.’’ [210] )
- rare occurrence of MRONJ

> Asymptomatic  patients  receiving  antiresorptive therapies for cancer
- If a dentoalveolar surgical procedure is unavoidable (eg, fractured tooth, advanced  periodontal  disease),  patients  should  be informed  of  the  associated  risks.  
- Nonrestorable teeth  may be  treated  by removal of the crowns and endodontic treatment of the remaining  roots. [213] Teeth  may  be  extracted  if  necessary. 
- Placement of dental implants should be avoided in the oncology patient receiving parenteral antiresorp- tive therapy or antiangiogenic medications. Case series and systematic reviews have reported necrosis associated with antiresorptive therapy and implant placement. [194,214-216]

> Asymptomatic  patients  receiving  antiresorptive therapy for osteoporosis
The  risk  for developing  MRONJ  when the indication is osteoporosis is:
- BPs: 0.02-0.04%

Sound recommendations based on strong clinical research design are still lacking for patients taking oral BPs.
In general, elective dentoalveolar surgery does not appear to be contraindicated in this group. Risk assess- ment for the development of MRONJ in these patients includes  the  above-stated  data  and  the  discussion above related to drug holidays.
The placement of dental implants in the context of antiresorptive therapy for osteoporosis continues to be an area of research interest. Several systematic re- views have acknowledged the lack of quality data and randomized clinical trials. Some studies have recom- mended caution, especially with a longer duration of therapy or steroid use.194,216 For example, in their sys- tematic  review,  Granate  et  al,216   identiﬁed  several studies that reported an elevated MRONJ risk associ- ated with implants placed in the posterior jaw if the duration of bisphosphonate therapy exceeded 3 years and if the patients were receiving systemic corticoste- roids. In contrast to these studies, systematic reviews by Gelazius et al, and Stavropoulos et al, reported no in- crease in risk.214,217 A recent retrospective propensity- matched cohort study of 44,900 patients reported a decreased   risk   of   ONJ   in   osteoporosis   patients receiving  implants  compared  to  matched  controls who did not have implants. Of note, 9,738 patients had a history of BP use, and the results for implants was in contrast to risk increase for patients who under- went tooth extraction.218
Reports of implant-related (MRONJ) necrosis can be divided into the early (implant surgery-triggered) or late  (implant  presence-triggered)  category.215,219,220 In these reviews, the majority of the implant-related necrosis were not related to the initial implant surgery but occurred  late  (>12  months) and  often  at sites where implants were placed prior to the initiation of bisphosphonate therapy. The common presentation was an en bloc failure, where the osseointegration of the   implants   is   maintained   within   the   seques- trum.220,221  This has been recognized as a separate pattern of failure that is distinct from the common peri-implantitis failure and considered by some to be pathognomonic of MRONJ. Although there are no pro- spective studies or systematic reviews pertaining to implant-related   necrosis   associated   with   RANKL inhibitors or other targeted therapies, AAOMS con- siders this to have a similar level of risk.
In summary, robust data do not exist, and available data are conﬂicting. Therefore, AAOMS suggests that if dental implants are placed, informed consent should be provided to include the low risk of MRONJ, as well as early and late implant failure. These patients should be placed on a regular long-term recall schedule.
